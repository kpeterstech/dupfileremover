Our Brothers

Justin Montana Williams

Published: October 2011

To those whom I've fought with
and to those I don't know your name
We fought by one another.
You did not die in vain.
We fought, you died,
We bled, and I cried, 
Even until our untimely end,
our country, our families, our brothers,
we shall defend
